                  This app provides emergency buttons for students for situations ranging
                  from violence to health-related emergencies. The security emergency button
                  inter-connected to the security communication system sends students details including
                   names, residence name and room number then notifies the security of the incident that
                  needs urgent attention based on the studentâ€™s location.
